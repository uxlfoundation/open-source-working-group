================================
 UXLF Open-Source Working Group
================================

The UXL Foundation Working Group defines, builds, and maintains UXLF open-source projects.

Meetings
========

The Working Group meets the 4th Tuesday of each month. Working group meetings track active work packages and discuss
opening new work packages.

* See `Meeting Notes`_.
* Recordings of the meetings are available in the Linux Foundation https://openprofile.dev/ profile. If you are a member
  of the Working Group, you can access this through your account.

Active Work Packages
====================

* `Open-Source Project Best Practices`_
* `Security Processes and Practices`_
* `Public CI Infrastructure`_

Projects
========

* `oneDNN`_:

  * The oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform performance library of basic
    building blocks for deep learning applications.

  * Upcoming `oneDNN Milestones`_: v3.9 (Aug 1, 2025); v3.10 (Oct 30, 2025)

* `oneMath`_:

  * The oneAPI Math Library (oneMath) defines a set of fundamental mathematical routines for use in high-performance
    computing and other applications.

  * Upcoming `oneMath Milestones`_: v0.8 (Jun 30, 2025); v0.9 (Nov 4, 2025)

* `oneDAL`_:

  * The oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a powerful machine learning library that helps you accelerate big data
    analysis at all stages: preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modeling, validation, and decision making.

  * Upcoming `oneDAL Milestones`_: Regular monthly releases

* `oneTBB`_:

  * The oneAPI Threading Building Blocks Library (oneTBB) is a flexible C++ library that simplifies the work of adding
    parallelism to complex applications, even if you are not a threading expert.

  * Upcoming `oneTBB Milestones`_: 2022.2.0 (Jun 30, 2025); 2022.3.0 (Oct 31, 2025)

* `oneDPL`_:

  * The oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) provides the functionality specified in the C++ standard, with extensions to
    support data parallelism and offloading to devices, and with extensions to simplify its usage for implementing data
    parallel algorithms.

  * Upcoming `oneDPL Milestones`_: 2022.9.0 (Jun 11, 2025); 2022.10.0 (Oct 16, 2025)

* `oneCCL`_:

  * The oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL) provides an efficient implementation of communication patterns
    used in deep learning.

  * Upcoming `oneCCL Milestones`_: 2021.16 (Jun 23, 2025); 2021.17 (Oct 24, 2025)

Communication
=============

* `Mailing List`_: Receive calendar invites and mailing list emails.
* `Slack`_: Join the "wg-open-source" channel.

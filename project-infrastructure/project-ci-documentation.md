# Project Infrastructure for CI and CD

UXL Foundation CI Infrastructure
================================

The table outlines the existing shared public CI available to UXL Foundation projects.

| Owner | Type | OS | Number | Active? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | CPU x86 | Linux, Windows, Mac | Up to 500 concurrent | Yes | |
| GitHub | CPU AArch64 | Linux, Mac | Up to 500 concurrent | Yes | |
| Intel | Intel GPU Max 1550 | Linux | Varies depending on request | Yes | |
| Codeplay | CPU AArch64 | Linux | Cloud-based | Yes | Available until 31 May |
| Codeplay | Intel GPU Battlemage B580 | Linux | 1 | No | |

The following sections gather together, for each UXL Foundation project, the existing public CI set up and the minimum CI requirements so that contributions can be received with confidence that sufficient testing has been done.
This document gathers together for each UXL Foundation project the minimum CI requirements so that contributions can be received with confidence that sufficient testing has been done.
Currently much of the project CI is hosted by internal corporate infrastructure, and is separated from the open source repositories.

This initiative is being kicked off to bring as much public CI as is possible for the UXL Foundation projects.

Basic required CI coverage includes reasonable OS coverage for all supported
platforms.

oneDNN is a performance library and includes multiple specialized code paths for
relevant hardware features. To test these code paths CI must include functional
and performance testing coverage for all hardware variants that have specific
implementations.

### *Required Public CI Infrastructure Needed To Confidently Accept Contributions*

Currently internal Intel CI validation is required for code verification. 
Intel employees can start internal CI with comment "/intelci: run" and corresponding CI would be triggered.
It's not possible to view these logs without access to Intel network

Migration to public validation is possible but will require more x86 systems available in public - currently public validation covers a small subset of validation scopes that we are planning to expand

| Instruction set architecture | Hardware Vendor | Processor Type | Operating System |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x86 | Intel | CPU | Ubuntu, Windows |
| AArch64 | Arm | CPU | Ubuntu |
| Xe, Xe2, Xe3 | Intel | GPU | Ubuntu, Windows |

Software Versions:
* C/C++ Compiler
* DPC++ Compiler and oneMKL if building with SYCL support
* BLAS and LAPACK libraries - both provided by oneMKL or openBLAS could be used 
* Python version 3.9 or higher
* oneTBB library (repository contains script to download it)
* oneDPL library if building with SYCL support
* Microsoft Visual Studio* (Windows* only)
* MSYS2 (Windows* only)
* make and dos2unix tools

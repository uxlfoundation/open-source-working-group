# Project Infrastructure for CI and CD

This document gathers together for each UXL Foundation project the minimum CI requirements so that contributions can be received with confidence that sufficient testing has been done.
Currently much of the project CI is hosted by internal corporate infrastructure, and is separated from the open source repositories.

This initiative is being kicked off to bring as much public CI as is possible for the UXL Foundation projects.

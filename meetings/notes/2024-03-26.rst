Open Source recommendations: Rod B.
===================================

* Rod had a follow-up discussion about the findings from looking at
  the `Red Hat open source checklist`_.
  * `Summary spreadsheet`_
  * `oneMKL report`_
  * `oneDPL report`_
  * `oneDNN report`_
  * `oneCCL report`_
  * `oneDAL report`_

* Q: More discussion about private vs public discussion.
  * Prioritize the kinds of information that other developers will
    need to know. Look at oneDNN RFC's as an example.

* Need to have some deadlines. Rod has created a github project: `open
  source checklist work package`_

GitHub Org Transition: Robert C.
================================

* `GitHub Org Slides`_
* We have to move GitHub repos to LF/UXLF ownership
* examined:
  1. taking oneapi-src
  2. moving to uxlfoundation
  3. every project has its own org: https://github.com/onednn-project/onednn

* Recommend option 3
* See the slides for details
* There were no strong objections, but we did not have representation
  from all the projects. Will follow-up with some slides that makes
  the recommendation clear, and a follow-up discussion.
